	        <p>“Learning should not stop even when one is away from the classroom. It need not rely on physical classroom space or the 8am-5pm school hours”.</p>
	        <p>This very thought initiated the journey to develop a future-ready Learning Management System that free up teachers’ time to focus on the real value-added activities, motivates students to imbibe as much knowledge as possible, and bring together teachers and students by creating an accelerated learning environment.</p>
	    	<p>
	    		Our user experience research revealed that in this era of digitization the one sector that has yet to come to speed is Education and Training which is still grappling with bringing together students, teachers and technology in a more impactful manner. There are ‘silos’ between teacher and students, students and their peers, and the way instructors teach and students prefer to learn. It is these ‘silos’ which we wish to destroy and build a more ‘integrated’ and ‘progressive’ learning environment.

	    	<p>
	    		We are passionate about technology, learning and solving the real world problems. Chalkkeeper is our answer to the education and training industry’s need for the next-gen learning management system.
	    	</p>
	    	<p>We are on a journey to connect the disconnected path of the educational systems. Are you with us? </p>
